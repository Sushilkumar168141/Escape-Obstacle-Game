# Escape-Obstacle-Game
Hello World ! I just tried to create a minigame inspired by Subway Surfers. 
In this game, the player  is characterized as a ball. Player has  to  avoid  obstacles and go as far as he can avoiding brick like obstacles, and collecting  coins and other  powerups  which helps the  player  to score more.
1. Score  is calculated on the  basis of distance covered.
2. As the player go farther, speed of the ball  increases, resulting  in increasing the difficulty.
3. Two  powerups available as of  now : 
    a. Magnet - It allows players to attract coins from a distant range.
    b. Shield - It allows players to go through the  obstacles.
4. Inventory system implemented,  which allow  player to buy balls and obstacles of  different colors.
5. Environment color of the  game changes continuously from one to another.
6. Player  can  control  the ball in three directions : Left,  Right and  Jump,
7. Player can also change the position of buttons  in settings according to his  play style.
8. Player can choose  whether he wants to  play the  sound and vibration  or not.
9. If balls collided with  the obstacles, game gets over and player  get 15 seconds to  decide for  an opportunity,  whether he want to  continue the game from there by investing some coins or he  wants to  end  the game. 
10. The  price  for new life  increases progressively in  the  game.
11. There is also a leaderboard  included  in the game where the players can see top 10 players  of all time.
12. Player can use golden ball if he is in  the  1st  position  in  the  overall leaderboard.
13. Player can use  golden  obstacle if he was on top of the leaderboard anytime even  once.
